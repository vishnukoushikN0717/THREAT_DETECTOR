# **ThreatDetector**

## **Abstract**
**ThreatDetector** is a lightweight and efficient vulnerability scanning tool designed to analyze PHP projects. It scans for potential security vulnerabilities in PHP files and provides a detailed report for developers. This tool is ideal for securing your applications and ensuring robust code quality.

---

## **Features**
- Scans all PHP files in the specified directory.
- Detects potential vulnerabilities and displays them in the terminal.
- Generates an HTML report for detailed insights.
- Simple configuration for different project directories.

---

## **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js** must be installed on your system.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Extract the Files**
- Extract the `ThreatDetector` folder to your desired location.
- Ensure that the `ThreatDetector` folder and your PHP project folder (e.g., `sample_files`) are in the same parent directory.

### **Step 2: Configuration**
1. Open the `config.js` file located in the `ThreatDetector` directory.
2. Locate the following line:
   ```javascript
   DEFAULT_PROJECT_PATH_TO_SCAN: "../sample_files/"
   ```
3. Replace `sample_files` with the folder name of your PHP project.
   - **Example**: If your project folder is named `my_php_project`, update it to:
     ```javascript
     DEFAULT_PROJECT_PATH_TO_SCAN: "../my_php_project/"
     ```
4. **Note**: Folder names are case-sensitive.

## **How to Run**

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `ThreatDetector` directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/ThreatDetector
   ```
2. Run the tool using the following command:
   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```
3. The terminal will display a list of detected vulnerabilities.
